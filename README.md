# AppState

**AppState** is a Swift 6 library designed to simplify the management of application state in a thread-safe, type-safe, and SwiftUI-friendly way. It provides a set of tools to centralize and synchronize state across your application, as well as inject dependencies into various parts of your app.

## Requirements

- **iOS**: 15.0+
- **watchOS**: 8.0+
- **macOS**: 11.0+
- **tvOS**: 15.0+
- **visionOS**: 1.0+
- **Swift**: 6.0+
- **Xcode**: 16.0+
  
**Non-Apple Platform Support**: Linux & Windows

> üçé Features marked with this symbol are specific to Apple platforms, as they rely on Apple technologies such as iCloud and the Keychain.

## Key Features

**AppState** includes several powerful features to help manage state and dependencies:

- **State**: Centralized state management that allows you to encapsulate and broadcast changes across the app.
- **StoredState**: Persistent state using `UserDefaults`, ideal for saving small amounts of data between app launches.
- **FileState**: Persistent state stored using `FileManager`, useful for storing larger amounts of data securely on disk.
- üçé **SyncState**: Synchronize state across multiple devices using iCloud, ensuring consistency in user preferences and settings.
- üçé **SecureState**: Store sensitive data securely using the Keychain, protecting user information such as tokens or passwords.
- **Dependency Management**: Inject dependencies like network services or database clients across your app for better modularity and testing.
- **Slicing**: Access specific parts of a state or dependency for granular control without needing to manage the entire application state.

## Getting Started

To integrate **AppState** into your Swift project, you‚Äôll need to use the Swift Package Manager. Follow the [Installation Guide](documentation/installation.md) for detailed instructions on setting up **AppState**.

After installation, refer to the [Usage Overview](documentation/usage-overview.md) for a quick introduction on how to manage state and inject dependencies into your project.
